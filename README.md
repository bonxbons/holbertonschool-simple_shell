Introduction to Simple Shell
</h1>
This is our Simple Shell project written in C, and our project was made to provide us with a better understanding of how a basic shell operates. Constructing our own shell involves navigating through the core concepts of system calls, process creation, and signal handling. As we delve into the intricacies of command parsing and execution, we aimed to grasp the fundamental principles that govern the interaction between users and the operating system. Through this hands-on experience, we anticipate honing our skills in C programming, enhancing our comprehension of memory management, and gaining insights into the nuances of concurrent processes. Our Simple Shell project is not just a programming exercise; it's a journey to unravel the layers of abstraction that surround the command-line interface, empowering us to build a foundational understanding of the software that forms the backbone of our computing experience.
